Features
========

Weâ€™ll walk through the features provided by TwitterServer by
examining a slightly more advanced version of the example shown in the
introduction.

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala
   :language: scala

Flags
-----

.. _flags:

The flags implementation, `found in Twitter's util library
<https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/release/util-app/src/main/scala/com/twitter/app/Flag.scala>`_,
focuses on simplicity and type safety, parsing flags into Scala values.

You define your flag like this, in that case the flag type is `String`:

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#flag
   :language: scala

But you can also define flags of composite type:

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#complex_flag
   :language: scala

We also provide an automatic help entry that displays information about
all the flags defined.

::

  $ java -jar target/myserver-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -help
  AdvancedServer
    -alarm_durations='1.seconds,5.seconds': 2 alarm durations
    -help='false': Show this help
    -admin.port=':9990': Admin http server port
    -bind=':0': Network interface to use
    -what='hello': String to return

Note that you cannot read flags until after the arguments have been
parsed, which happens before premains have been executed, but after
the constructor and the inits.  Similarly, you should only declare a
flag in the constructor, before the arguments have been parsed.

As a precaution, we recommend turning on the `failfastOnFlagsNotParsed`
option within your server. Having this option turned on means that if
a `Flag` is attempted to be accessed before the flag has been parsed,
then an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#fail_fast
   :language: scala

Logging
-------

TwitterServer uses the `Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) <https://www.slf4j.org/>`__
for framework logging. 

.. admonition:: From the SLF4J documentation

    "The Simple Logging Facade for Java serves as a simple facade or
    abstraction for various logging frameworks, such as
    java.util.logging, Logback and log4j. SLF4J allows the end-user to
    plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time."

As such, in order to log with `TwitterServer` you must 
`depend on an actual logging implementation <https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping>`__.

.. tip::

  `Logback <https://logback.qos.ch/>`__ is a native `slf4j-api <https://www.slf4j.org/>`__ 
  implementation and is the recommended logging implementation for `TwitterServer`.

Since `TwitterServer` uses the `slf4j-api <https://www.slf4j.org/>`__  for logging it no 
longer provides the |util-logging Logging|_ logging implementation directly. As such, logging 
configuration is handled on the choosen imlpementation and by default not through flags -- except 
in the case of choosing the `slf4j-jdk14` logging implementation. 

See the `Backwards Compatibility <#backwards-compatibility-via-slf4j-jdk14>`__ section.

Backwards Compatibility (via `slf4j-jdk14`)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. includecode:: code/BackwardsCompatServer.scala
   :language: scala

To continue using `TwitterServer` with no changes to your logging, simply depend on the 
|twitter-server/slf4j-jdk14|_ library which will use `slf4j-jdk14` as the |slf4j|_ logging 
implementation, then mix in the |com.twitter.server.logging.Logging|_ to your `TwitterServer`.

Example:

.. includecode:: code/BackwardsCompatServer.scala#server_obj
   :language: scala

In the above example, the |com.twitter.server.logging.Logging|_ has been renamed to ``JDK14Logging``
for clarity.

The |com.twitter.server.logging.Logging|_ provides a logger named `log` which can be configured via 
the command line flags: `-log.level` and `-log.output`.

.. includecode:: code/BackwardsCompatServer.scala#log_usage
   :language: scala

See: |c.t.logging.Logging|_ for more details on what flags can be used for configuring JUL loggers.

Log Format
++++++++++

To change the format of the log output, a custom `Formatter` is needed.
This is best done by overriding the `defaultFormatter` provided by the
|com.twitter.server.logging.Logging|_.

.. includecode:: code/BackwardsCompatServer.scala#formatter
   :language: scala

.. note::

  For more complicated logging schemes, you can extend the |com.twitter.server.logging.Logging|_
  and mix it back into a `TwitterServer`.

Dynamically Change Log Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Per-logger log levels can be changed on-the-fly via a logging handler on the
admin interface for supported |slf4j|_ logging implementations. Instead of depending on an
|slf4j|_ logging implementation directly, depend on the `TwitterServer` wrapper for the logging 
implementation which will provide the appropriate logging handler.

Supported implementations:

=======================           =================================
Implementation                    Dependency
=======================           =================================
java.util.logging (JUL)           |twitter-server/slf4j-jdk14|_
Log4j                             |twitter-server/slf4j-log4j12|_
Logback (recommended)             |twitter-server/logback-classic|_
=======================           =================================

.. _metrics_label:

Metrics
-------

Note: In order to enable usage of the Metrics library, you must have the
finagle-stats jar on your classpath.  Before version 6.39.0, `finagle-stats`
depended on libraries which can be found in the `https://maven.twttr.com
<https://maven.twttr.com>`_ repository.

The `statsReceiver` field of `TwitterServer` defines a sink for
metrics. With it you can update counters and stats (histograms) or
define gauges (instantaneous values) which are documented `here <http://twitter.github.io/util/guide/util-stats/basics.html#gauges>`_

For instance, you define your stats:

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#stats
   :language: scala

And update the value:

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#stats_usage
   :language: scala

The value of this counter will be exported by the HTTP server and
accessible at /admin/metrics.json. To see an example of the counter
incrementing run the following:

::

  $ curl -s localhost:9990/admin/metrics.json | jq '.requests_counter'
  0

  $ curl -s localhost:9990/echo
  hello

  $ curl -s localhost:9990/admin/metrics.json | jq '.requests_counter'
  1

One thing to note is that histograms are windowed, so stats may disappear after
a minute.  We window histograms so that we have a consistent amount of data each
time we read the histograms, so that each request has a similar impact on the
statistics.

If we didn't window histograms, the early requests would have a big influence on
the computed statistics, and as the application continued to run, each request
would have progressively less and less of an impact.

Filtering stats out
*******************

Metrics can be too expensive to store. By passing a comma-separated
list of regexes to exclude from stats using
`-com.twitter.finagle.stats.statsFilter` flag, one can single out the
stats that will not be shown when queried with `filtered=true`. In
other words, you can still access all of the stats normally, but this
adds the option to fetch the filtered list.

For example, to filter out all stats starting with jvm and also any
p90 stats, one can pass the following to TwitterServer:

::

-com.twitter.finagle.stats.statsFilter="jvm.*,.*\.p90"

To query the reduced list:

::

/admin/metrics.json?filtered=true

Note that this only works with `finagle-stats` and doesn't work with
`finagle-ostrich4`.

Changing metrics verbosity
**************************

By default, TwitterServer doesn't export `debug metrics`_ (assuming finagle-stats
is used as a metrics library). Override the `com.twitter.finagle.stats.verbose`
`tunable`_ (a comma-separated list of glob expressions under toggle map `finagle`)
to allowlist debug metrics, potentially without application restart.

For example, the following JSON file placed in the resource folder (restart
required) as `com/twitter/tunables/finagle/instances.json` will allowlist
Netty 4 metrics for a given JVM process.

::

  {
    "tunables":
    [
       {
          "id" : "com.twitter.finagle.stats.verbose",
          "value" : "finagle/netty4*",
          "type" : "java.lang.String"
       }
    ]
  }


Pretty output
*************

If you would like a pretty version of the json output, add the
parameter pretty=true or pretty=1, eg /admin/metrics.json?pretty=true

::

  {
    "requests_counter": 234,
    "finagle/closes": 575,
    "finagle/connection_duration.avg": 561,
    "finagle/connection_duration.count": 592,
    "finagle/connection_duration.max": 299986,
    "finagle/connection_duration.min": 3,
    "finagle/connection_duration.p50": 31,
    "finagle/connection_duration.p95": 120,
    "finagle/connection_duration.p99": 197,
    "finagle/connection_duration.p9990": 2038,
    "finagle/connection_duration.p9999": 2038,
    "finagle/connection_duration.sum": 332690,
    "finagle/connections": 2,
    "finagle/http/failfast/unhealthy_for_ms": 0,
    "finagle/http/failfast/unhealthy_num_tries": 0,
    "finagle/success": 0
    ...
  }

Exported Metrics
----------------

See the `Finagle user guide <https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Metrics.html>`_
for a comprehensive catalog of the metrics that are exported by Finagle.

Histograms
----------

`TwitterServer` exports histogram-style metrics from your service, which
typically represent a quality of a common event.  These events might include
queries (how wide is my query?), requests (how long did my request take?),
retries (how many retries did I have), etc.  Visualizing these histograms can
help us better understand the different classes of events that can happen.  For
example, maybe you think some of your requests are slow because your garbage
collection pauses are too long.  You might compare latency histograms from
before and after increasing your heap size to check whether you were
right. Assessing this is much harder with only the standard statistics (p50,
p90, etc), but with the full PDF, you can see the bad mode flatten out.

As with Metrics, in order to work with histograms you must have the
finagle-stats jar on your classpath.

API Parameters
**************

There are two endpoints for histograms, `/admin/histograms.json` and `/admin/histograms`.

`/admin/histograms.json` will always return the full list of histograms.

::

  $ curl http://a.twitter.server/admin/histograms.json

  {
    "clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms" : [
      {
        "lower_limit" : 5,
        "upper_limit" : 6,
        "count" : 28
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 6,
        "upper_limit" : 7,
        "count" : 9188
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 7,
        "upper_limit" : 8,
        "count" : 25164
      }
    ],
    "jvm/gc/eden/pause_msec" : [
      {
        "lower_limit" : 8,
        "upper_limit" : 9,
        "count" : 1
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 9,
        "upper_limit" : 10,
        "count" : 1
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 53,
        "upper_limit" : 54,
        "count" : 1
      }
    ]
  }

`/admin/histograms` is more flexible, and can display a single histogram in many ways.
The following parameters control how a histogram is displayed.

1) "h": the name of the histogram you want to see.
2) "fmt": the desired format: raw | pdf | cdf | plot_pdf | plot_cdf
3) "log_scale": the scale used for the x-axis: true | false

For visualization, we provide both PDF_ and CDF_ options.  A PDF is a
probability density function, which is a plot from the value of the histogram to
the proportion of events that had that value.  It's useful for seeing the
different modes of a distribution, which typically represent different classes
of events. A CDF is a cumulative distribution function, which is a plot from the
value of the histogram to the proportion of events that had that value OR had
less than that value.  This effectively does smoothing, in case there aren't
very many samples.

The `plot_*` formats are rendered in a chart UI, while other formats export the
histograms buckets. A histogram bucket consists of a lower and upper limit and a
count. Any value falling inside a bucket's limits is treated the same and adds 1
to the count.

Here's an example where we query histogram counts for request latency. Each
bucket is mapped to the number of requests which had a latency less than or
equal to the bucket's upper limit.

::

  $ curl http://a.twitter.server/admin/histograms?h=clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms&fmt=raw

  {
    "clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms" : [
      {
        "lower_limit" : 5,
        "upper_limit" : 6,
        "count" : 28
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 6,
        "upper_limit" : 7,
        "count" : 9188
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 7,
        "upper_limit" : 8,
        "count" : 25164
      }
    ]
  }

Here's an example where we query a cumulative distribution function (CDF). Each
bucket is mapped to a percentage of requests which had a latency less than or
equal to the bucket's upper limit.

::

  $ curl http://a.twitter.server/admin/histograms?h=clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms&fmt=cdf

  {
    "clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms" : [
      {
        "lower_limit" : 5,
        "upper_limit" : 6,
        "percentage" : 6.444885E-5
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 6,
        "upper_limit" : 7,
        "percentage" : 0.03286891
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 7,
        "upper_limit" : 8,
        "percentage" : 0.15292539
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 8,
        "upper_limit" : 9,
        "percentage" : 0.26998794
      },
      {
        "lower_limit" : 9,
        "upper_limit" : 10,
        "percentage" : 0.41753477
      }
    ]
  }

Plotting the "finagle/timer/deviation_ms" cumulative distribution function:

::

  $ chrome http://a.twitter.server/admin/histograms?h=clnt/p2cslowservertest-server/request_latency_ms&fmt=plot_cdf

.. image:: ../../img/HistogramCDF.png
.. _CDF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function
.. _PDF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function


While plotting graphs of your metrics, you can switch between formats using the
buttons.  Log scale is typically good for looking at high percentiles.

Custom Implementations
**********************

Histograms are normally only available for services that use a
`MetricsStatsReceiver` (default), but it is also possible to provide a custom
one. A custom `StatsReceiver` must implement the `WithHistogramDetails` trait,
and it should be service-loaded.

Admin HTTP interface
--------------------

TwitterServer provides an HTTP server and includes a variety of tools
for diagnostics, profiling, and more. The details are covered in-depth
:ref:`here <admin_interface>`.

Lifecycle Management
--------------------

TwitterServer exposes endpoints to manage server lifecycle that are compatible with
`Mesos's <https://mesos.apache.org/>`_ job manager:

**/abortabortabort**
  Abort the process.

**/health**
  By default, respond with content-body "OK". This endpoint can be managed manually by mixing in
  the Lifecycle.Warmup trait with your server.

**/quitquitquit**
  Quit the process.


These entries are the default, but if you need you can add your own handler to this HTTP server:

.. includecode:: code/AdvancedServer.scala#registering_http_service
   :language: scala

Extension
---------

TwitterServer can be extended modularly by mixing in more traits. If
you want to alter the behavior of a trait that is already mixed into
`TwitterServer`, you can override methods that you want to have
different behavior and then mix it in again. For example, in the
`Logging
<https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/release/util-logging/src/main/scala/com/twitter/logging/App.scala>`_
trait, you can override loggers to change where you send logs.

If you want finer grained control over your server, you can remix
traits however you like in the same way that the `TwitterServer
<https://github.com/twitter/twitter-server/blob/release/src/main/scala/com/twitter/server/TwitterServer.scala>`_
trait is built.
