HTTP Admin interface
====================

.. _admin_interface:

TwitterServer starts an HTTP server and includes a variety of tools
for diagnostics, profiling, and more.
It binds to the port defined by the :ref:`flag <flags>`
`-admin.port` and uses port 9990 by default.

Visit `/admin` on your service's admin port in a web browser to see what is
available.

TwitterServer defines a series of default endpoints grouped into a variety
of categories.

- :ref:`Process Info <admin_info>`
- :ref:`Utilities <admin_utilities>`
- :ref:`Metrics <admin_metrics>`
- :ref:`Profiling <admin_profile>`
- :ref:`Downstream Clients <admin_clients>`
- :ref:`Listening Servers <admin_servers>`

Process Info
------------

.. _admin_info:

Endpoints that provide insights into your service's configuration and usage.

/admin/lint
~~~~~~~~~~~

Runs and displays the results for all registered linters to check for various
service issues. This can help you identify misuse or abuse of functionality.

.. image:: ../../img/lint.png

/admin/threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user interface for capturing the current stacktraces. Includes filtering
of inactive threads as well as deadlock detection. JSON output is also available
through tools like curl via the inspection of the HTTP Accept header.

.. image:: ../../img/threads.png

/admin/registry.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays how the service is currently configured across a variety of dimensions
including the client stack, server stack, flags, service loader values,
system properties, environment variables, build properties and more.

.. image:: ../../img/registry.png

The HTTP request parameter `filter` allows for simple filtering of the returned data.
The value takes the form "path/to/data" and returns registry entries whose prefix
matches the parameter. A glob, `*`, can be used to match any component of the path.
For example, using "filter=registry/server/http" will output all Finagle Http servers.
Using "filter=registry/client/\*/user_service" would output all Finagle clients with
a label of "user_service" regardless of protocol.

Due to the usage of `/` as a delimiter, it means you cannot match components
containing a `/`. The choice of `*` as a glob also means you cannot match registry
components with the exact value of `*`. For these use cases, there is the
more powerful `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ command-line JSON processing
tool.

/admin/server_info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return build information about this server.
See `/admin/registry.json` for this in addition to other details.

::

  {
    "name" : "myserver",
    "version" : "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "build" : "20130221-105425",
    "build_revision" : "694299d640d337c58fadf668e44322b17fd0562e",
    "build_branch_name" : "refs/heads/twitter-server!doc",
    "build_last_few_commits" : [
      "694299d (HEAD, origin/twitter-server!doc, twitter-server!doc) Merge branch 'master' into twitter-server!doc",
      "ba1c062 Fix test for sbt + Jeff's comments",
    ],
    "start_time" : "Thu Feb 21 13:43:32 PST 2013",
    "uptime" : 22458
  }

/admin/announcer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a set of announcement chains that have run through the
`Announcer`. This allows one to see how a particular target is being
announced.

Utilities
---------

.. _admin_utilities:

Endpoints that cover various utilities that developers can manipulate at runtime.

/admin/events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user interface for collecting and viewing runtime events to make it easier to
diagnose production issues. This includes logging by default, while metrics are included
if you are using ``finagle-stats`` and tracing events are included if you are
using ``finagle-zipkin``. JSON output is also available
through tools like curl via the inspection of the HTTP Accept header.

.. image:: ../../img/events.png

/admin/tracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable (`/admin/tracing?enable=true`) or disable tracing (`/admin/tracing?disable=true`)

See `zipkin <https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin>`_ documentation for more info
regarding tracing.

/admin/logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display the set of loggers and their current log level. The level of
each logger can also be modified on-the-fly.

.. image:: ../../img/logging.png

/admin/toggles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See and modify the server's in-memory mutable `com.twitter.finagle.toggle.Toggles`.

`GET` requests show the current state of all `StandardToggleMap StandardToggleMaps`.
Requests should be of the form `/admin/toggles{/$libraryName}{/$id}`.
Note that the library name and toggle id components are optional and allow
for filtering the output on those constraints.
The output is JSON and it looks roughly like:

::

  {
    "libraries": [
      {
        "libraryName" : "$libraryName",
        "toggles" : [
          {
            "current" : {
              "id" : "$id",
              "fraction" : $fraction,
              "description" : "$description"
            },
            "components" : [
              {
                "source" : "$ToggleMapSource",
                "fraction" : $fraction
              },
              { <other sources here> }
            ]
          },
          { <other toggles here> }
        ]
      },
      { <other libraries here> }
    ]
  }

There will be a hash for each library registered with
`com.twitter.finagle.toggle.StandardToggleMap`. For each `Toggle`
the "current" hash shows the current configuration while the
"components" array has a hash per `ToggleMap` source. These
are ordered by evaluation order and as such, sources earlier in a
component array are used first.

`PUT` requests allow for updates/creation of the mutable `Toggles`
while `DELETE` requests allow for removal. These apply only to the
`ToggleMap.Mutable` `ToggleMaps` within a `StandardToggleMap`.
Requests must be of the form `/admin/toggles/$libraryName/$id`.
For create and update, and an additional `fraction` request parameter
must be set as well.

/admin/tunables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See and modify the server's in-memory mutable `com.twitter.util.tunable.Tunables`.

`GET` requests to `/admin/tunables` show the current state of all registered
`StandardTunableMap StandardTunableMaps`. The returned JSON is of the form:

::

  [
    {
      "id" : "$id",
      "tunables" : [
        {
          "id" : "$tunableId",
          "value" : "$value",
          "components" : [
            {
              "source" : "$TunableMapSource",
              "value" : "$value"
            },
            { <other components here> }
          ]
        },
        { <other tunables here> }
      ]
    },
    { <other ids here> }
  ]

`GET` requests to `/admin/tunables/$id` show the current state of the StandardTunableMap
registered for `$id`.

`PUT` and `DELETE` requests to `/admin/tunables/$id` update the in-memory Tunables for `$id`
and should have a JSON body in the same format as a `Tunable` configuration file,
detailed in
`JsonTunableMapper <https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/master/util-tunable/src/main/scala/com/twitter/util/tunable/JsonTunableMapper.scala>`_:

::

  {
    "tunables":
      [
         {
            "id" : "$tunableId",
            "value" : $value,
            "type" : "$class"
         },
         { <other updates here> }
      ]
  }

For a `PUT` request, these `Tunables` will be updated or added. Note that `PUT` requests
will *not* cause any existing `Tunables` to be removed.

For a `DELETE` request, these `Tunables` will cleared from the `TunableMap`. The `Tunables` are keyed
by "id" and "type"; the "value" for each of `Tunables` to delete can be any valid value for this
`Tunable`. Because the value of a `Tunable` is the result of a composition of `TunableMaps`
(see `StandardTunableMap <https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/master/finagle-tunable/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/tunable/StandardTunableMap.scala>`_), deleting an in-memory Tunable will cause the value from the
composition of the other TunableMaps to be used.

Metrics
-------

.. _admin_metrics:

Endpoints regarding your service's metrics. The `Finagle User Guide
<https://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Metrics.html>`_ explains what
many of them represent.

/admin/metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Watch specific metrics in real-time.

.. image:: ../../img/metric_watch.png

/admin/metrics.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Export a snapshot of the current statistics of the program. You can
use the StatsReceiver in your application for add new
counters/gauges/histograms, simply use the `statsReceiver` variable
provided by TwitterServer.

This endpoint is available when you are using the `finagle-stats` library.
See the :ref:`metrics <metrics_label>` section for more information.

/admin/histograms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualize and download histogram-style metrics.  The metrics endpoint exposes a
summary of the histogram, but it doesn't expose the full histogram.  The full
histogram can be useful for seeing the different modes of your metric, which often
represent different states of your program.

This endpoint is available when you are using the `finagle-stats` library.
See the :ref:`metrics <metrics_label>` section for more information.

For more details, please see the features
`documentation <https://twitter.github.io/twitter-server/Features.html>`_.

.. image:: ../../img/HistogramCDF.png

/admin/histograms.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Export a snapshot of a histogram-style metric in json. This exports the entire
histogram, which can be used for correctly aggregating over a cluster, or to
efficiently record historic histogram data, or to compare modes in different
usages patterns, like times of day.  You may add new histograms by adding new
stats to your `statsReceiver` variable.

This endpoint is available when you are using the `finagle-stats` library.
See the :ref:`metrics <metrics_label>` section for more information.

Profiling
---------

Endpoints for profiling your process.

.. _admin_profile:

/admin/pprof/contention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a CPU contention profile which identifies blocked threads
(`Thread.State.BLOCKED`).
The output is in `pprof <https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools>`_ format.
The process will be profiled for 10 seconds at a frequency of 100 hz. These
values can be controlled via HTTP request parameters `seconds` and `hz`
respectively.

/admin/contention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show call stacks of blocked and waiting threads.
